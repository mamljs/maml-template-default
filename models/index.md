# maml

`maml` is a static website generator taking `markdown` and `yaml` as input.

`maml` is short for "markdown yaml" and pronounced as `['mɑːmel]`.

`maml` = `markdown` + `yaml`

Chinese name is `马猫儿`.


## Features

##### affected by Ruby on Rails

- The folder structure is very similar to Ruby on Rails: `assets`, `controllers`, `models`, `views`.
- Convention over configuration.


##### Simple and easy to use

- Every page is a folder on disk, and every folder contains two files: `index.md` and `index.yml`.
- Configurations files could inherit, thus you don't need to specify everything for each page.
- It works out of the box.


##### Flexible

- If you are a developer and you can change the things in controller and views, then you can gain infinite flexibility.
- It could be as flexible as Ruby on Rails(without those dynamic features since it is a static website generator).
